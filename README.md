# aStarPathFinding
 A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualizer. A friend and I created this program for a high school python class for the final. At least 6 years old with some minor things. Can add and remove walls by clicking empty squares and adjust how big the grid is within the code. Forgot most of how we did this but it exists still.
